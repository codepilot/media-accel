media-accel
===============

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

The purpose is to be a cross platform media accelerator.
3d rendering/gaming is the primary focus for this project.

This library in it's future will provide NodeJS with access to:
	OpenGL for 3d rendering/gaming, up to the current or 4.3 whichever is greater
	Direct3d for 3d rendering/gaming, up to the current or 11.2 whichever is greater
	OpenCL for computing, up to the current or 2.0 whichever is greater
	OpenAL for sound, up to the current or 1.1 whichever is greater

nehe-lesson05.coffee and other coffee files used by it are derived from
the NeHe example number 5, see http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/3d_shapes/10035/

The current state of this library is that it contains only enough c++ code to
make the lesson 5 work.
